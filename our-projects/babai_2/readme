usage $./babai_3 x foo
where x is equal to 0 or 1.
If x=1, then foo=[[...],..,[....]]:matrix [....]:target vector
If x=1, then foo is a txt file which contains a matrix and the target vector as previous, but there is a blank line between them
Example : $./babai_3 0 [[1,2],[3,4]] [0,45]
          $(0,46)
          $./ babai_3 1 matrix
where matrix is the file : 
[[2,3,4,5,4,5,6,7],[1,-9,-5,3,-1,-2,-3,4],[1,90,89,78,56,45,12,34],[12,345,654,789,543,1234,-56,-7],[2,-3,-4,-5,-1,-2,-3,-4],
[1,90,89,78,67,56,45,34],[-4567,45,67,89,12,54,43,32],[90,78,98,78,67,12,34,56]]

[1,0,0,0,1,2,3,5]
we get   
          $(4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3)
